- WHy does it work? is geometry not related with forces?


- Is that a gamma function with fmin = 0?


- What kind of distribution do I expect if I change width or alpha? check
Now I am printing normalized. If width is too small, I need a lot of samples
to get good statistics, but the shape does not change.
If alpha is increased, I will need to increase also alpha to improve exploration
of larger forces, otherwise I will need to wait for so long after many samples.
