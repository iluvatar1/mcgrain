1 value : NC. Number of contacts
2 value : NGEOMETRY. Number of times to test a geometry, important for random mode
3 value : NITER_GEO. Number of iterations per geometry. Should be larger than NEQUI.  
4 value : MODE. Contacts Mode: 0 = fixed, 1 = random
5 value : SEED. Seed for random number
6 value : WIDTH. Fnew -> Fold + [-width, width]
7 value : ALPHA. alpha = 1/p0, p0 = Mean external value for pressure p
8 value : NEQUI. Equilibrium time :  iterations to perform before start taking samples
9 value : NCORR. Correlation time : Number of iterations between (independent) samples.
